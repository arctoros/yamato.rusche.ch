            When I started playing Tetris, I opted for tetr.io, the go-to platform for modern Tetris. 
            However, after spending many hours playing there, I found the site to be heavy and sluggish, 
            so I tried to recreate it myself to see if I could do any better.<br/><br/>
            Some parts are sadly unfinished and buggy due to a lack of time and fading interest. Also, 
            I've found that it's quite hard to recreate the quick and snappy movement in tetr.io.<br/><br/>
            Nevertheless, I have attached the link and the files below for anyone who might want to try it out for themselves.
